  ### Group Project 2 : PaaS 

  ##### Problem Description:
  Our project implements a smart classroom assistant for educators. This app takes in videos from the userâ€™s classroom and performs face recognition on them. The results of face recognition are looked up in the database. These results are used for returning the relevant academic information of each student back to the user.
